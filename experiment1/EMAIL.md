Hello, thank you for agreeing to participate in our experiment!

In this repository, you will find a starter NextJS library in `/experiment1/template-app/`.

Your task is to integrate the module as provided in `optimized-perf/index.ts` into the starter app. You can find the module in `/experiment1/example-app/`.

Once you have the middleware in place, use the middleware to grab the `quality` value from the middlware and render the `quality` value in a text component.

Getting started instructions are outlined in `/experiment1/template-app/README.md`.
